# SMTP Server Automation Setup

## Introduction

This project is an attempt to automate the setup of an SMTP server using Postfix and Dovecot. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use script that sets up a fully functional SMTP server with minimal user intervention.

## Prerequisites

- A server running a Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu)
- Root or sudo access to the server
- Basic knowledge of shell scripting and Linux command line

## Features

- Automated installation and configuration of Postfix
- Automated installation and configuration of Dovecot
- Secure email transmission using TLS
- Support for virtual domains and users
- Easy to customize and extend

## Configuration

The main configuration files for Postfix and Dovecot are:

- **Postfix:** `/etc/postfix/main.cf` and `/etc/postfix/master.cf`
- **Dovecot:** `/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf` and `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/*`

The setup script will generate these files based on your input. You can manually edit these files later if you need to make additional changes.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start using your SMTP server. Some common commands you might need are:

- **Restart Postfix:**
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart postfix
    ```

- **Restart Dovecot:**
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart dovecot
    ```

- **Check the Status of Postfix:**
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl status postfix
    ```

- **Check the Status of Dovecot:**
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl status dovecot
    ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the log files for more information:

- **Postfix Logs:** `/var/log/mail.log` and `/var/log/mail.err`
- **Dovecot Logs:** `/var/log/dovecot.log` and `/var/log/dovecot.err`
